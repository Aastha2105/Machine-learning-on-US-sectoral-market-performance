# Machine-learning-on-US-sectoral-market-performance

The project observes the data of the stocks in S&P 500 from 2020-2022 to analyse
the results of the most optimal clustering across 11 different sectors. The historical
stock data is taken from Yahoo Finance API. The 11 different sectors taken in
accordance to Global Industry Classification Sectors (GICS), which consists of 500
stocks of the US stock market which make up for 125 sub industries in total. In
conducting the research, the returns and volatility values have been (mean = 0,
variance = 1) to make the dataset less noisy to ensure that the clustering algorithm
performs well. The dataset used for purposes of clustering analysis spans from 1st
January 2020 to 31st December 2022. As mentioned, three clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical and Affinity
Propagation Clustering are first adopted to visualise the effect on the stock market
for the period 2020-2022. In this project, the returns and volatility of S&P 500
stocks across different industries is used as a basis for measuring the impact.
